<!-- All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file. -->

## A section

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
